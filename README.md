# CyberSecurity


## Introduction

The technique of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from hostile intrusions is known as cyber security. Threats to networked systems and applications can come from inside and outside an organization, and cybersecurity solutions are designed to combat them.

Cyberattacks are simply exploitation of computer systems or networks. Cybercriminals launch these attacks to steal secured information. Not only can cybercriminals steal information, but they can also alter, delete, disable, manipulate or destroy the data. The attacks are launched by several methods such as phishing, malware, MitM, SQL injection, Denial-of-Service, etc. Attackers send malware through software, app updates, or any link.

Customers' personally identifiable information (PII) — names, addresses, national identification numbers, and credit card information — is targeted by cybercriminals, who then sell the data on underground digital marketplaces. Customer trust is frequently lost due to compromised PII, resulting in regulatory fines and legal action.


## Categories of Cyber Security

### Cyber Security applies in various categories such as:
•	**Network Security**: The practice of safeguarding a computer server from attackers, presumably planned hackers or indiscriminate malware, is known as network security.

•	**Information Security**: Data integrity and privacy are protected by information security, both in retention and transportation.

•	**Application Security**: It aims to protect software and devices from malicious assaults. Security starts throughout the design phase, long before software or device is deployed.

•	**Operational Security**: The processes and decisions for managing and securing data resources are included in operational security. It also consists of the protocols that dictate how and where data may be kept or exchanged and users' permissions while accessing a network.

•	**End-User Education**: End-user education handles the most unexpected aspect of cyber-security: people. By failing to follow appropriate security measures, anyone can inadvertently transmit a virus into an otherwise secured system. It is critical for every organization's security to teach users to delete suspicious email attachments, not plug in unrecognized USB drives, and a variety of other vital teachings.

•	**Disaster recovery and business continuity**: It is used to describe how a company reacts in the case of a cyber-security breach or any other catastrophe that results in the loss of operations or data.


## Common types of attacks
 
• **Malware**: Malware is used to describe malicious software, spyware, or worms. Malware is inserted into a system through networks in any link or email attachment. Once you click that link, malware or harmful software gets installed. Once installed, it can manipulate your system's data, block access to the network, and obtain information by transmitting data from the hard drive. 

• **Phishing**: This is the most common cyber threat. The virus is transmitted to steal important information such as credential login information or send malware to the system to spy. The malware is sent through email that appears to be coming from an original and reputable source. 

• **Man-in-the-middle attack (MitM)**: This attack is also known as an eavesdropping attack as the attackers insert themselves into a two-party transaction. In simple words, on an unsecured WiFi network, the attackers can insert themselves in between the user's device and the web. As a result, the user will unknowingly pass away all the information to the attackers. After the virus has breached the target's device, it can install the software to obtain all the victim's information.

• **SQL injection**: Structured Query Language attack or SQL attack is a dangerous form of malicious attack that attackers can launch by simply injecting malicious code to the server. If the attacker sends a malicious code to the server that uses SQL, it will reveal all the information to the attacker that it would not normally do. The attacker can also attack a server by simply writing and submitting the malicious code in the website's search box.

• **Brute force attack**: This is a modern-day attack that targets different social media accounts and websites with private user profiles. In a brute force attack, an attacker guesses and makes a combined list of usernames and passwords, and then they brute force those usernames and passwords in the website server to access the victim's account.

• **Ransomware**: Ransomware is a sort of virus that encrypts files, data, or computers and threatens to delete or destroy the data unless a ransom is paid to the hackers who began the attack. Recent ransomware attacks have targeted state and municipal governments, which are easier to hack than businesses and are under pressure to pay ransom to restore critical apps and websites that citizens rely on.

• **Ransomware**: Ransomware is a type of computer virus that encrypts files, data, or systems and threatens to erase or destroy the data unless the hackers who started the attack are paid a ransom. Recent ransomware attacks have targeted state and municipal governments, which are easier to hack than businesses and are under pressure to pay ransom to restore critical apps and websites that citizens rely on.

• **Insider Threats**: Current or former employees, business partners, contractors, or anyone who has previously had access to systems or networks and misused their access permissions can all be considered insider risks. Traditional security solutions that focus on external threats, like as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, may be blind to insider dangers.

• **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks**: A DDoS attack damages a server, website, or network with traffic, usually from numerous synchronized systems, to bring it down. DDoS assaults use the simple network management protocol (SNMP) used by modems, printers, switches, routers, and servers to overwhelm enterprise networks.

• **Advanced persistent threats (A.P.T.s)**: An A.P.T. is when an attacker or a gang of attackers enter a system and go undiscovered for a long time. The intruder keeps networks and systems untouched to spy on company activities and collect essential data while evading the triggering of protective countermeasures. An example of an A.P.T. is the recent Solar Winds penetration of U.S. federal computers.


## Types of attackers
 
**♦ Black Hat Hackers**: Black Hat Hackers are basically "Bad Hackers" who gain unauthorized access to your systems to steal important information. They usually attack to earn a massive amount by selling data or sometimes do it for fun. Anyone can be Black Hat Hackers, from beginners to advanced hackers, as their main motive is to steal important information from victims.

**♦ White Hat Hackers**: The "Good Hackers" are known as White Hat Hackers. The process is known as "Ethical Hacking." These hackers work for several organizations and companies that launch attacks on their websites to check for security vulnerabilities. They use the penetration testing method to ensure that their security systems are in place. 

**♦ Grey Hat Hackers**: As you can figure out from the name itself, Grey Hat Hackers are those hackers who are known both for "Bad Hat Hackers" and "White Hackers" as well. They perform attacks, and if they find any vulnerability, they inform the company or the organization about it. But, they also demand compensation for the information, and if not rewarded with the same, they also warn about exploiting the vulnerabilities.


## Latest Cyber Threats

Many cyber threats are continuously reported. Talking about some of the most recent cyber threats that the U.S.U.S., U.K.U.K., and Australia have reported:

**• Dridex malware**: Dridex is a form of malware that targets its victim's banking information. Dridex is a multi-purpose financial trojan. Since 2014, it has infected systems using phishing emails or existing malware.

It has caused enormous financial losses equivalent to hundreds of millions of dollars by stealing passwords, banking credentials, and personal data used in fraudulent transactions.

**The US Department of Justice (DoJ)** charged the leader of an organised cyber-criminal cell in December 2019 for his role in the global Dridex malware campaign. This nefarious attempt affects the general public, government, infrastructure, and industry all across the world.

**The National Cyber Security Centre of the United Kingdom** encourages the public to ensure devices are patched, antivirus is turned on and up to date, and files are backed up.


## How to detect Dridex malware?
As the threat evolves, it isn't easy to detect this malware. Perhaps, individuals can utilize technologies that focus on signature-based threat detection to see Dridex. Some tools, for example, may use machine learning to model network data and understand patterns of regular user activity. Unusual traffic can then be noticed and investigated further. Some virus detection tools may function if it detects unusual behavior or.exe files. As a result, some anti-malware programs will see Dridex.


## Protection against Dridex
•	When opening email attachments from unknown senders, be cautious.
•	Don't open files given to you from unfamiliar or dubious email addresses.
•	Download files from reputable sources only.
•	Maintain the most recent versions of your software and browsers.
•	Educate co-workers on how to spot dangerous spam.



**• Romance scams**: It occurs when a criminal creates a false online identity to earn confidence and affection. Romance scams happen when a criminal makes a mistaken online identity to gain trust and appreciation. The scammer then manipulates and steals from the victim by creating the illusion of a loving or close relationship.

## How to detect Romance scams?
You can detect scammers in the following ways:
•	 Fast to fall in love. Claims to be in another country on business or for military duty.
•	They demand money and attempt to entice you away from the dating service.
•	Claims to require funds for an emergency, medical bills, or travel.
•	They plan to visit but cannot do so due to a family emergency.

## Protection against Romance Scams
•	*Cross-check and verify*: Conduct an online search to verify the person's identity, including their name, photo, location, email address, and other facts.

•	*Please slow down and talk to someone you trust*: Tell a friend or family member about your issue and talk with them about your future steps. A romance scam artist may try to keep you secluded from your friends and family, or drive you to make reckless decisions on your own. Don't be rushed into deciding by a con artist.

•	*Do not send money*: Never give money to an internet love interest through wire transfer, gift card, or cash reload card. Remember that you are never going to get it back.

•	*If you have already sent money, report it*: If you believe you've sent money to a scammer, contact your bank institution straight once.



• **Emotet Malware**: Emotet is a Trojan horse disseminated mainly through spam emails. Malicious scripts, macro-enabled document files, and malicious links are possible ways to get infected. Emotet emails may have familiar branding to make them appear natural. Emotet may utilize enticing wording such as "Your Invoice," "Payment Details," or possibly a forthcoming shipment from well-known parcel businesses to convince people to click the malicious files. The Australian Cyber Security Centre issued a warning to national entities in late 2019 about a widespread global cyber threat posed by the Emotet virus.

## How to detect Emotet malware?
Organizations can use email security technology like Proofpoint Advanced Threat Protection to help detect known threats, malicious attachments, and unsafe URLs, or use a sandbox security platform like Palo Alto Networks Wildfire. It integrates with your next-generation firewall to detect and analyze known or unknown attacks, including malware, to discover and defend against malware like Emotet.

*According to Blumira's Director of Security Mike Behrmann*, other security solutions for an additional layer of defense include cloud-based next-generation antivirus (N.G.A.V.), which can help you spot threats faster based on behavioral detection.

## Protection against Emotet Malware
•	Keep your computer and endpoints up to date with the newest Microsoft Windows patches.
•	Don't open strange attachments or click on a link that appears to be sketchy. If you don't open those suspicious emails, Emotet won't be able to gain a foothold on your system or network.
•	Create a strong password and start using two-factor authentication.
•	You can defend yourself against Emotet by implementing a multi-layered cybersecurity approach.


## Cyber Security myths

•	People think that cybercriminals are primarily outsiders. In truth, hostile insiders, working for themselves or collaborating with outside hackers, are frequently the source of cybersecurity breaches. Insiders can be members of well-organized groups with nation-state assistance.

•	The dangers are well-known to everyone, so there are low chances of attack. Thousands of new vulnerabilities have been reported in both old and new applications and devices, indicating that the risk surface is growing. Human error is becoming more common, particularly for careless workers or contractors that inadvertently trigger a data breach.

•	People in business think that their industries are safe. Cyber adversaries take advantage of the communication network requirements of virtually every government and private-sector body, threatening every enterprise.

•	The attack avenues have been stifled. Cybercriminals are always coming up with new attack vectors, such as Linux systems, operational technology (O.T.O.T.), Internet of Things (IoT) devices, and cloud environments.



## Biggest Global Popular Cyber Attacks

•	**Big Basket data breach, November 2020**: In November 2020, the Cyber Security firm Cyble reported the hack. Nearly 20 million users' data of the online grocery platform were hacked. The firm said several data that included phone numbers, email I.D.sI.D.s, passwords, delivery addresses, order details such as order value, last order date, number of times ordered, etc., has been leaked and put up on sale for about Rs. 30 lakh. The company said that there is no compromise of users' data as their website doesn't save any users' credit card or bank details. They also said that all the hashed passwords had been removed and moved to a secured OTP-based authentication process.

•	**India's largest bank, S.B.I.'s data breach**: In January 2019, customer data with over 740 million accounts based on their global customers were leaked. A messaging and call-based app known as S.B.I. Quick had an unprotected server. This app was for the customers who could give a missed call or message on the specified number to know information about their bank account, including balance, recent transaction, block A.T.M. card, and learn about the home or car loans. The app had an unprotected server which attackers took into a grant. The server allowed anyone to view all the messages sent to the customer in real-time, including their numbers and partial bank account number. A technological-based news website asked a researcher to send a message to the app. In no time, they were able to see the phone number of the researcher and the message sent back to him on the database. As per the bank, no financial damage occurred, or no account P.I.N.s were compromised. Later on, the server of S.B.I. Quick was protected overnight.

•	**Red Cross Server Hack**: The Red Cross has discovered that an unpatched vulnerability led to compromising personal data belonging to more than half a million "extremely susceptible" persons. The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) said on Wednesday (February 16), nearly a month after discovering and announcing the hack, that its investigation had come across a very advanced and planned attack. To disguise themselves as legitimate users or administrators, attackers tailored harmful code for ICRC servers and anti-malware systems, used sophisticated obfuscation techniques, and used hacking tools. After discovering the incident on January 18, the ICRC says it took the hacked servers offline. On November 9, 2021, it believed its servers were compromised. According to the report, the attack vector was a major REST API authentication bypass in Zoho ManageEngine ADSelfService Plus, password management, and single sign-on (SSO) platform fixed in September 2021.

•	**Russian nation-state hackers are after critical defense material from U.S. contractors**: The F.B.I. has cautioned that Russian state-sponsored spies have been targeting U.S. contractor networks to get essential defense information for six months. According to a joint statement from C.I.S.A., the F.B.I., and the N.S.A., major and minor C.D.C.s and subcontractors have targeted various cybersecurity processes and resources. From January 2020 to February 2022, the U.S. Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (C.I.S.A.) detected "frequent targeting" of U.S. cleared defense contractors (C.D.C.s), according to a statement released on February 16.

•	**Cyber Attack at Vodafone Portugal**: A planned and malicious cyber-attack on Vodafone Portugal knocked out mobile networks across the country. The outage disrupted customers' access to 4G and 5G networks and digital T.V. and SMS services, which began on Monday evening (February 7). Vodafone Portugal claimed in a statement that as soon as the first symptom of a network fault was noticed, they responded quickly to identify and restore services. They claimed to have regained mobile voice and data services exclusively on the 3G network in practically every country. Still, due to the scope and severity of the illegal conduct they were subjected to, all other services will require meticulous and extensive work. They also said that no customer data had been accessed or compromised due to the incident.

• **Famous Sparrow**: A new cyberespionage group called “FamousSparrow” is found targeting hotels, Governments, and private companies worldwide. They are using ProxyLogon exploit (A vulnerability of Microsoft Exchange) along with their custom backdoor, “SparrowDoor” to target hotels.

According to ESET researchers, the group has been active since August, 2019. Telemetry reports revealed that this group has exploited Microsoft Exchange vulnerabilities since March 3, 2021 i.e., the day after Microsoft released security patches. The group is mainly targeting hotels; however they have also targeted Government organizations, international companies, and law firms in dozens of countries.

Matthieu Faou and his colleague Tahseen Bin Taj uncovered “FamousSparrow”. Experts found connections between FamousSparrow and SparklingGoblinand and DRBControl group. However, researchers say that this group has its own entity. They most likely share access to victims and tools. Faou said that the group is not strong enough on the malware part, but has evolved since before in targeting. He also added that, they mainly target hotels so that they can keep track of their targets’ travel habits. They can also breach hotels’ WiFi infrastructure to spy on the non-encrypted network traffic.

They deploy several custom tools such as variants of Mimikatz, NetBIOS scanner Nbtscan, and a small utility that drops ProcDump on disk, which drops another process to gather in-memory secrets i.e., credentials. They also dropped one of their own custom tools “SparrowDoor” that could fully control any compromised machine by executing arbitrary command or exfiltrating content of files.


## Protection against Cyber Attacks

This generation is all about technology and social media. With the advantages of these advancements also comes a technical disadvantage which forces us to surrender our private accounts unknowingly. You must know all of these that I will discuss below to keep your system and version safe.

• **Secure passwords**: You know about securing your system as well as all your essential files, but do you know that you need to keep your password secured too? Keep yourself safe from all the online attacks; keep your passwords protected by using solid and extensive passwords.

• **Privacy**: Many of you may think you don't have any private data, so you don't need privacy. But that's completely wrong! Your data are all over the apps and websites that you use online. This data which you may not think is important, is a goldmine for attackers.

• **Data breaches**: Data breaches are another essential security issue that you need to know. Attackers target companies to obtain information about individual workers. These data are profitable as attackers can sell them on the black market to earn a massive amount. 

• **Safe computing**: Many threats are on standby when you are computing, and you cannot be saved from all threats immediately, which is a disadvantage of technology. However, if you use computer Internet Security, you can be protected from many dangers, as the application will warn you before the occurrence. 

• **Mobile protection**: Nowadays, we have shifted to mobiles and tablets and stored our data more than laptops or desktops. Cybercriminals are always on standby to insert themselves between our devices and the network. Thus, I suggest you learn more about mobile security and apply them to save yourself from all these threats.

• **Online scams**: These are the threats that not only a technically mastered attacker can launch, but anyone with the basic knowledge can attack. You can see that nowadays, most people fall for such scams through email or phone calls. These scams are launched to gain A.T.M. pins or mobile data. You may think yourself too technically mastered to fall for these scams, but you never know! So, learn about all these scams and be alert while handling your secured data.


## Conclusion

Cyber-security specialists find new dangers and strategies to counteract them, and security programs evolve new defenses. Employees must be trained on utilizing end-user security software to protect themselves.

Businesses are now more linked than they have ever been. Your systems, users, and data all exist in different settings and operate in different ways. Security on the perimeter is no longer sufficient, yet establishing security controls within each environment adds complexity. In both circumstances, the effect is a deterioration in protecting your most valuable assets.

Companies do not want to believe that they have been hacked, and some only take action after they have been hacked, and some give up easily on all these. As companies or organizations, you need to be alert all the time. Test the security of all your websites and apps by ethical hackers or online available security tools, and always keep your system updated. Back up your data, and be prepared for any breach because "Precautions are always better than cure."
 
You must handle your accounts safely and be alert while sending your private data files as a user. Use long and strong passwords for all your accounts, including upper case and lower case characters, memorable characters, and numbers. Use Internet security tools, and keep your system updated. Do not fall for scams that ask you to reveal your P.I.N. or passwords. Think before clicking any links and downloading any software on your system or mobile that may include malware. Surf safely! 

So, always keep your data as secure as possible and keep your devices up-to-date. Be safe on the internet!
